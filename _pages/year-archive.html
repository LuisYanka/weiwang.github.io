<h1>Fall 2024</h1>

In this seminar, we mainly discuss the book "<a href="https://math.stanford.edu/~lms/ntu-gmt-text.pdf" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Geometric Measure Theory</a>" by L. Simon (abbreviated as [Sim14] in the following table). We also refer to the book "<a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9780203747940/measure-theory-fine-properties-functions-lawrencecraig-evans" rel="nofollow">Measure Theory and Fine Properties of Functions</a>" for additional references. The reading seminar is held mostly every Thursday and Sunday afternoon from 14:00 to 16:00 at the Jiayibing or Zhihua buildings of Peking University. Occasionally, due to the special schedules of the attendees, the time may change, and the seminar may be held online.
